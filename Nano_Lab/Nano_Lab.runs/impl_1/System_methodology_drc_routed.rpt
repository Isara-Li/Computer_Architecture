2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Nano_Processor_Zero/Program_Counter_3bit_Zero/D_FF_2/Load_sel_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Nano_Processor_Zero/Instruction_Decoder_Zero/Jump_Flag_reg/CLR, Nano_Processor_Zero/Instruction_Decoder_Zero/Load_sel_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
